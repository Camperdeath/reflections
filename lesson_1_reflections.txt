How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
 was introduced?

    

I could see the exact lines where i changed my file and compare those two, to find differences



How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

   
I can easily change code and  revert it back in case i make mistakes or i do not like the changes that were made.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

   

 
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

   

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    



By using git log, i can see all the different versions from that repository. With git diff i can then see the changes between two versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
 could break something?

   


I can easily check ,in which version i introduced a bug and i can always revert my program to the version from before.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
